Hello, 

This repository will show you what im able to do in most popular programming languages. In my opinion, i dont have any trouble when it comes to writing some basic code in html, css or javascript which i hope you will be able to see.
Moving forward i started to create python scripts/php code, but visual simplicity of python and the fact that it is used in a variety of other purposes got me. I must say i still really like this language up to this date, so i decided that i want to study python more.
Currently im trying Django and i would love to try myself in a real project.

HERE are my short project previews, which i filmed and i highly suggest you to watch:
